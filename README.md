# Sol Mate e-Paper Display ☀️

I initially made [the ☀️ Sol Mate GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-QIydQSFRm-sol-mate), but it didn't take too long until I wondered what it would look like on [an e-Paper display](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMQ83W7W).

This repository contains all the code that was needed to generate and display a weather report for any specified location on a Raspberry Pi with an attached Waveshare e-Paper display.

You will need to specify an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. The code will load environment variables from a `.env` file in the same directory.
